        The reality of living with dirty water can seem far away, but water is everything and everything needs  water. We take this global problem very personally and invite you to do the same.
        <br>
        <br>
        Filter builds are opportunities for you to make something that 663 million people need: a way to clean their water.
        <br>
        And, volunteering your time keeps the cost of these filters much lower, allowing us to reach more people.
        <br>
        If you want to put your hands on a solution to a global crisis, here's your chance.

        We'll start with a brief overview of the global water crisis and a bit about the technology we're building. Then we'll jump in.
        <br>
        Different filters require different systems, some are kid-friendly, others require gluing and cutting. The registration page will tell you everything you need to know.
        <br>
        No special degrees or skill sets required. Experienced leaders will guide you through each station and help ensure we're producing high-quality filters that will stand the test of time.

        Custom builds are scheduled at the request of a group (6 or more people).
        <br>
        Businesses, clubs, small groups, field trips. Anyone looking to meaningfully engage their team or group in a hands-on activity with a tangible global impact can request their own event.

        In most cases, your group will travel to our build site. There are so many items and tools involved in building filters that it's logistically difficult to host builds at your location.

        You don't need to create an account to register for a filter build, but there are some perks:
        <ul>
          <li>Plan to build often? Let the system keep track of your upcoming and past builds.</li>
          <li>Want credit for the hours you've spent? If you turn in hours to your school or employer, our system can provide a record of those hours.</li>
          <li>Make it easy to change plans. We know things change. Logging in makes it easy to change or cancel your registration.</li>
        </ul>
        This system is not the same as our donor management software, so your password will be different. This is an intentional security feature.
