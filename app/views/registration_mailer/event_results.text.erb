Hello <%= @recipient.fname %>,

Thanks for coming to the filter build on <%= @event.format_date_only %>!

We built <%= pluralize(@event.technology_results, @technology.name) %>!
These filters will make dirty water clean for <%= pluralize(number_with_delimiter(@event.results_people, delimiter: ','), 'people') %> and produce <%= pluralize(number_with_delimiter(@event.results_liters_per_day, delimiter: ','), 'liter') %> of clean water every day for at least <%= pluralize(number_with_delimiter(@event.results_timespan, delimiter: ','), 'year') %>

By volunteering your time to build filters, you helped make them more affordable to people who need access to clean water. And access to clean water has the power to change everything for vulnerable families. Starting with improving health, saving and earning more money, and keeping kids healthy enough to attend school more often.

Thanks for providing life, health and prosperity to people you'll probably never meet in this lifetime.
